# list-post-contributors

List Post Contributors is _my first WordPress plugin_ that I ever built.

This plugin was built as an assignment, over a weekend. The completion of this plugin marks the first milestone in my WordPress learning journey.

This plugin _provides the option to choose and list the contributors of a post_.

Contributors in this plugin refers to
- Administrator
- Author
- Editor
